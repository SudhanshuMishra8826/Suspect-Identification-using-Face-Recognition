# Suspect-Identification-using-Face-Recognition

In this project I have used face recognition to build an application to detect a suspect using the continous video frames or even a single frame, the same process can used to build various other identification systems like attendance marking.

The project is built using flask to create a webserver.

A client side code for sending continous frames (video) is also included in which video is being recorded from a ip camera or a smartphone having any ip camera app.
